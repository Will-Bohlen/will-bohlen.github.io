Heidelberg University's Honors program "fosters free and rigorous intellectual inquiry through an emphasis on interdisciplinarity, civic engagement, independent research, and individually-driven academic exploration." The curriculum centers around four areas: 'The Scholar', 'The Scientist', 'The Artist', and 'The Citizen.' Students take seminars in each of these topics, as well as service learning course and a capstone research project.
